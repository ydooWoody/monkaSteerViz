# monkaSTEERViz

Visualize controller inputs with an interactive monkaSTEER. It's pretty goofy.
## How to run

Using OBS/SLOBS 
1. Add the html file as a browser source.
2. Under settings/properties for the source change the height/width to 1000/1000.
3. (Optional, but nice) Use custom framerate and set to 60fps
** (OBS seems to have a browser source lag issue on their end(?), If it gets too noticable resetting the source will fix the issue. No idea if slobs has the same issue, looking into it.) **

(By default the background is transparent because idk why it wouldnt be, but that (like most things), is labeled in the html file for changing.)

## How to use

All settings can be changed simply in the html file, just modify according to the instructions there. Default button layout is: 

- RightTrigger/X = Accelerate

- LeftTrigger/A = Brake

- LeftStick = Steering

(CPU usage is fairly minimal, but if you experience slowdowns for some reason, there are settings/toggles that can help with that)
